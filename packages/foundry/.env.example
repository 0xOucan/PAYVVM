# ====================================
# Foundry Environment Variables
# ====================================
#
# ⚠️  NOTE: For most variables, use the CENTRALIZED .env at the root!
#
# The root .env file (../../.env) contains shared variables like:
#   - RPC_URL_ETH_SEPOLIA
#   - RPC_URL_ARB_SEPOLIA
#   - ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
#   - ARBISCAN_API_KEY
#
# This file is for Foundry-specific local overrides only.
# Run setup from root: ../../setup-env.sh
#
# ====================================

# DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY is used while deploying contract.
# On anvil chain the value of it can be empty since we use the prefunded account
# which comes with anvil chain to deploy contract.
# NOTE: You don't need to manually change the value of DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, it should
# be auto filled when run `yarn generate`.

# Alchemy rpc URL is used while deploying the contracts to some testnets/mainnets, checkout `foundry.toml` for it's use.
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=oKxs-03sij-U_N0iOlrSsZFr29-IqbuF
# Etherscan API key is used to verify the contract on etherscan.
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=DNXJA8RX2Q3VZ4URQIWP7Z68CJXQZSC6AW
# Default account for localhost / use "scaffold-eth-custom" if you wish to use a generated account or imported account
LOCALHOST_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT=scaffold-eth-default
